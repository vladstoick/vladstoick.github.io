### **King's College London** (2015-2018)

I studied at King's College London from 2015-2018 where I graduated
with a First Class with Honours in **BSc Computer Science With Management**. During each
year of study I have been awarded the _Computer Science with Management Prize_.
The prize is given by the Department of Informatics for achieving the highest grade from the course.

My Final Year Project (_Dissertation_) was an automated SQL grading tool
with partial grading. I have built a Ruby library and a Ruby on Rails
web application which allow students to submit SQL solutions
and receive instant feedback and hints in case they make errors.
The source code is available on Github for the [Ruby library](http://github.com/vladstoick/fyp_sql_assess)
and the [web application](https://github.com/vladstoick/fyp). The final report's
TeX is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/vladstoick/fyp_reports).

### **National College of Computer Science Tudor Vianu, Bucharest** (2007-2015)

I have studied Computer Science since 1st grade and participated
at various competitive programming contests including National Olympiads.
During high school, I have participated at 2 National Olympiads of Computer Science
and received **two Silver Medals**.
