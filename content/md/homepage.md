## ðŸ‘‹ Hi

I am a Software Engineer based in London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. I have graduated from
**King's College London** (BSc in Computer Science with Management)
in 2018 with a First degree. I am currently on holiday until August when
I will start to work at **Facebook London**.

I have previously worked at [**Wonderbly**](https://wonderbly.com)
(or Lostmy.name as it was previously called) as a Backend engineer for
almost 3 years during my studies.
