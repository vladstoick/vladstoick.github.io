## ğŸ‘‹ Hi

I am a Software Engineer working at **Facebook London ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§**. I have graduated from
**King's College London** (BSc in Computer Science with Management)
in 2018 with a First degree and the highest grade from the course.

I have previously worked at [**Wonderbly**](https://wonderbly.com)
(or Lostmy.name as it was previously called) as a Backend engineer for
nearly 3 years during my studies.
