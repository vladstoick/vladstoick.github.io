# Biography

I am a second year student at King's College London studying Computer Science with Management.
In my first year, I have achieved a first grade and I also obtained "Computer Science with Management Prize" for achieving the highest grade from my course.

I have been working as a backend developer at [Lostmy.name](https://lostmy.name)
for over a year where we have a backend built on the e-commerce platform [Solidus](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus).
The backend handled over 1,800,000 books sold in over 184 countries.
