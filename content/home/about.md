# Biography

I am a third year student at King's College London studying Computer Science with Management.
In my first year, I have achieved a first grade and I also obtained "Computer Science with Management Prize" for achieving the highest grade from my course.
In my second yer, I have also achieved a first grade with the highest grade from my course, obtaining the same prize for the second year students.

I have been working as a backend developer at [Lostmy.name](https://lostmy.name)
for over a year where we have a backend built on the e-commerce platform [Solidus](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus).
I am part of the Core team that handles everything after cart: payments, shipping, tracking shipment and building tools
for customer support. My most important tasks were:

- Implementing two new payment methods: Klarna & Braintree Cards
- Implement a shipment tracking system that uses Aftership for tracking packages and Twilio for sending messages to customers all over the world in different languages.
- Update the backend application from a Solidus 1.* with Rails 4 to a Solidus 2.* with Rails 5
- Contribute multiple PRs to Solidus ([PRs](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avladstoick+is%3Aclosed))
- Implement a taxation system for Australia & EU
- Lead various projects for increasing speed of our test suite built on RSpec
